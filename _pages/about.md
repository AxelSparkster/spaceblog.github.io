Nice to meet you! I'm Axel Sparkster, some dude with a fennec fox character that has a lot of hobbies ranging from drawing to coding, art, traveling, languages and everywhere in between.

I created this blog because I wanted it to mainly document my forays into web development and use my experiences to help people, though there may be posts about many of my other various hobbies as well.
