Nice to meet you! I'm Axel Sparkster, some dude with a fennec fox character that has a lot of hobbies ranging from drawing to coding avd traveling and everywhere in between.

I created this blog because I wanted it to mainly document my forays into web development, but also anything relating to coding and maybe some art posts once in a while. My hobbies frequently rotate, so the content on this blog might rotate as well!
